# PawAdopt
This is the frontend of my pet adoption application. 

The application enables users to search for and adopt pets, while also offering owners the ability put an animal up for adoption. If a user decides to adopt a pet, they can enter their information via a web form, which is then sent to the animal's owner via email. This allows the owner to contact the potential adopter and arrange the adoption details.
